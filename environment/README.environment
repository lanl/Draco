Draco Development Environment
========================================

Draco provides default environment settings through:
 - Default .bashrc and .cshrc files
 - Emacs setup/macros/indentation defaults.

Recommended use:

1. From $HOME/.bashrc add a command to source draco/environment/bashrc/.bashrc.

2. From $HOME/.emacs add an instruction to load draco/environment/elisp/draco-setup

3. If you don't use (1), you can still use the Draco modules by sourcing
   draco/environment/Modules/init/bash or if you already have the module command in your
   environment, simply run 'module use draco/environment/Modules/hpc' or similar.
