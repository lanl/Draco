Draco is an object-oriented component library geared towards numerically
intensive, radiation (particle) transport applications built for parallel
computing hardware.  It consists of semi-independent packages and a robust build
system.  The packages in draco provide a set of components that can be used by
multiple clients to build transport codes.  The build system can also be
extracted for use in clients.

To clone draco:

    $ git clone https://github.com/lanl/Draco.git

To get started, please see [Development - Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/lanl/Draco/wiki/Development---Quick-Start)
in the wiki. Pull requestes must satisfy the requirements listed in
the [Style Guide](https://github.com/lanl/Draco/wiki/Style-Guide).

Synopsis of Active Draco Packages
---------------------------------

* c4 - A communications library for message passing interfaces (MPI).
  * For builds without MPI, all communication commnds will be no-op functions
    (`DRACO_C4={MPI;SCALAR}`).
* cdi - Access to material data. The Common Data Interface (CDI) specifies a
  common abstraction for objects and libraries that return material data
  (opacities, atomic cross sections, equation-of-state data, etc.)
* cdi_analytic - Analytic models for physical data
* cdi_eospac - Equation-of-State data
  * These classes wrap the EOSPAC6 libraries that read sesame files; Commonly
    used to access gray opacity data and heat capacities.
   (`EOSPAC_LIB_DIR=<path>`).
* cdi_ipcress - Gray and multigroup opacities
  * The classes in this component will read and parse opacity values from an
    IPCRESS file produced by TOPS.
* compton - Provides access to Compton scattering models and data as provided
  by the CSK library.
* device - Wrapper for heterogeneous device communication
  * The classes in this component provide access to DaCS (deprecated) and CUDA
    calls for use on heterogeneous architecture platforms (GPU machines).
* diagnostics - CPP macros that are activated at compile time that can provide
  additional diagnostic verbosity during calculations.
* ds++ - Basic services and data structures library.
  * Array containers, assertion and Design-by-Contract, access to low level OS
    functions, file and path manipulation, unit test system, etc.
* fit - Least squares fitting routines.
* fpe_trap - Catch IEEE floating point exceptions
* FortranCheck - Test Fortran compatibility and interoperability
  * The examples in this component will demonstrate if the Fortran compiler is working; if Fortran/C interlanguage linking/running is working and sample ISO_C_BINDING calls.
* lapack_wrap - C++ wrapper for BLAS and LAPACK.
* linear - direct solvers for small linear systems of equations.
* mesh - Encapsulate mesh definition and accessors.
* mesh_element - defines fundamental mesh element types used by mesh,
  meshReaders and RTT_Format_Reader.
* meshReaders - Read RTT format mesh files.
* min - Optimization routines. Find the minimum of a function.
* norms - Calculate norms for data sets.
* ode - Ordinary differential equation solvers (e.g.: Runge-Kutta).
* parser - Lexical file/input parser.
* plot2d - C++ interface to XMGrace 2-dimensional plotting.
* quadrature - access to angular integration functions and related data.
* rng - A random number generator component
  * The primary set of functions provided by this component were derived from
    Random123 (https://www.deshawresearch.com/downloads/download_random123.cgi)
    random number library.  A few additional random number generators are also
    provided.
* roots - Root finding algorithms
* RTT_Format_Reader - meshReaders implementation for RTT format mesh files or
  input-streams.
* shared_lib - Dynamically load/unload shared object libraries via dl load
* special_functions - Specialized math functions like factorial and Dirac delta.
* timestep - An object-oriented class that encapsulates a time step controller.
* traits - A traits class used by viz.
* units - Provides encapsulated unit systems, functions to convert between unit
  systems and physical constants.
* VendorChecks - A testing component to ensure that discovered and used vendor
  libraries behave as expected.
* viz - Generates Ensight files for data visualization.
