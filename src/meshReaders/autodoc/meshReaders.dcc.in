\section intro Introduction

The classes contained in the rtt_meshReaders name space are designed
to provide a capability to read a variety for mesh file formats.
Access to the various mesh formats is provided via a
rtt_meshReaders::Mesh_Reader base class from which all the specific
format readers inherit. Addition of readers for new formats is thereby
simplified. The base class provides a variety of methods which can be
used to discover details of the computational mesh such as node
coordinates, element connectivity, mesh regions, etc. The
rtt_meshReaders::Element_Definition class provides descriptive
information on the mesh elements which are used to consruct a mesh.

  <h3> Supported Mesh Formats </h3>
  The following formats are supported in the initial release:

  <dl>
    <dt> RTT Format

    <dd> A format locally developed by the RTT. Supported by the
         rtt_meshReaders::RTT_Format derived class. Originally
         designed specifically to support radiation transport problem
         definitions, this is a full featured format capable of
         describing almost any mesh structured or unstructured. An
         ASCII text file.  Currently RTT files can be produced by both
         the <a href="http://www.icemcfd.com/"> ICEM </a> and <a
         href="http://ees.lanl.gov/EES5/x3d/" > X3D </a> mesh
         generation packages.
    <dt> CIC-19 Hex Format
    <dd> A format locally developed by the RTT. Supported by the
         rtt_meshReaders::Hex_Mesh_Reader derived class. Originally
         designed as a simple test file format for initial debug and
         development efforts. ASCII text file. Generated by a small
         locally developed driver. Only generates hex, quad, and line
         logically rectangular meshes.
  </dl>

\section future Future Plans

The following formats are under consideration for possible support in
the future:

  <dl>
     <dt> CGNS Format
     <dd> <a href="http://www.cgns.org/" > CGNS </a> is an emerging
          industry standard for the exchange of computational physics
          data.  It is supported by an industry consortium which
          includes Boeing, NASA, and Rolls-Royce, and is being
          submitted for certification as an ISO standard.
     <dt> GMV Format
     <dd>  <a href="http://www-xdiv.lanl.gov/XCM/gmv/" > GMV </a> is
          a free mesh visualization tool developed at Los Alamos
          National Laboratory. Many LANL codes provide output links in
          the GMV file format
     <dt> Ensight Format
     <dd> <a href="http://www.ceintl.com/" > Ensight </a> is a
          popular commercial visualization tool marketed by
          Computational Engineering International. Many RTT and other
          LANL codes provide output links to this file format.
