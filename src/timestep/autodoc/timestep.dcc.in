\version Draco-@Draco_VERSION@

\section timestep_intro Introduction

The classes contained in the rtt_timestep name space are designed to provide
automatic control of the time step size in a time dependent numerical
simulation. In a typical simulation, several physics packages may be repeatedly
called from a host code to advance the overall system state. A time step manager
class (rtt_timestep::ts_manager) is provided to contain any number of time step
advisors (rtt_timestep::ts_advisor) from any package in the simulation. Each
advisor provides a recommended time step based on some physical parameter
specific to the package. After collecting information from each advisor, the
time step manager considers all the inputs and provides an overall
recommendation for the size of the time step for the next time cycle.
Capabilities are provided to:

<ul>
 <li> limit the min and max timestep,
 <li> force the time step to a user input value,
 <li> display informational advisors,
 <li> print a variety of summaries,
 <li> limit the rate of change in the time step
 <li> control the time step based on estimated rate of change in
      a user selected physical parameter,
 <li> attempt to hit a "target" time.
</ul>

\section timestep_intended_use Intended Usage

The intended usage is as follows:

-# Host-code instantiates the desired global (i.e. package
   independent) time-step advisor(s).
-# Host-code instantiates a ts_manager, and loads references to
   advisor(s) created in 1) above into the manager list.
-# Each package in the host code, at package construction, is passed
   in the manager, and instantiates any desired time-step advisors and
   loads references to the new advisors into the time-step manager.
-# ***Begin loop over time ***
-# Host-code responds to any user query about advisor(s), and sets
   advisor control parameters, based on user interactive input or some
   pre-determined script.
-# Host-code sets cycle data of manager (dt, cycle#, time).
-# Each package updates, if required, the recommended time step for
   each advisor "owned" by that package.
-# Host-code updates recommended time step(s) of global advisor(s) not
   owned by any particular package, if required.
-# Manager evaluates recommendations from each advisor on the list,
   calculates new time-step, and prints results if desired.
-# *** End loop over time ***
-# At package destruction, each package removes the advisors
   created in 3) above from the manager.
-# Host-code removes global advisors from the manager list.
-# Host-code destructs manager.
.
\section timestep_other Other Draco Packages

The time step manager utility uses the Draco ds++ (rtt_dsxx) services
library, and the Draco c4 (rtt_c4) communication library.
